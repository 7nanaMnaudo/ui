The book was written in response to a pamphlet published by a Muslim cleric named Maulana Sanaullah Amritsari, who had insulted Hindu gods and goddesses. The author of Rangila Rasool used the same style of mockery and ridicule to portray Muhammad as a lustful and immoral person who married multiple women, including a child bride and his daughter-in-law[^2^].
 
The book sparked outrage among the Muslim community in India, who demanded that it be banned and the author be punished. In 1927, a Hindu publisher named Rajpal was arrested for printing and distributing the book. He was acquitted by the Lahore High Court, but was later assassinated by a Muslim fanatic named Ilm-ud-din in 1929[^2^].
 
Rangila Rasool Urdu Pdf 24 is an online version of the book that can be downloaded for free from various websites. The book is still banned in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and is considered offensive and blasphemous by many Muslims. However, some people view it as a historical document that exposes the hypocrisy and corruption of organized religion[^1^].
  
The controversy [ edit] The publication of Rangila Rasul provoked a strong reaction from the Muslim community, who considered it a grave insult to their prophet and their faith. They filed a complaint against Rajpal under Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code, which prohibited the promotion of enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. [^1^] However, the Lahore High Court dismissed the case on the grounds that Section 153A did not apply to religious criticism or satire, and that the book did not incite violence or hatred against Muslims. [^2^] [^3^]
 
The acquittal of Rajpal outraged the Muslims, who organized mass protests and rallies across India, demanding that the book be banned and the publisher be punished. They also appealed to the Privy Council in London to overturn the verdict, but their appeal was rejected. [^4^] Some Muslim leaders, such as Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, tried to use the controversy as a political tool to mobilize the Muslim masses for their nationalist and anti-colonial agenda. They argued that the British government was biased and indifferent to the sentiments of the Muslims, and that only an independent India could protect their rights and dignity. [^5^]
 
Other Muslim leaders, such as Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and his followers of the Ahmadiyya movement, took a different approach. They claimed that they had the true interpretation of Islam and that they could defend Muhammad from any slander or mockery. They challenged the author of Rangila Rasul and other critics of Islam to a public debate on the merits and demerits of their respective religions. They also published several books and pamphlets in response to Rangila Rasul, such as Muhammad in World Scriptures by Maulana Abdul Haq Vidyarthi and The Truth about Rangila Rasul by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad.
 
The assassination [ edit] The controversy reached its climax on 6 April 1929, when a young Muslim man named Ilm-ud-din (also known as Ilm Deen or Alam Din) stabbed Rajpal to death in his shop in Lahore. Ilm-ud-din was arrested and confessed to his crime, saying that he was motivated by his love for Muhammad and his anger at Rajpal for publishing Rangila Rasul. He was tried and sentenced to death by hanging by the British authorities.
 
Ilm-ud-din became a hero and a martyr for many Muslims, who hailed him as a Ghazi (a warrior of Islam) and a Shaheed (a witness of God). He was defended by prominent lawyers such as Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal, who tried to save him from execution. He was also visited by several Muslim leaders and scholars in prison, who praised him for his courage and devotion. His funeral was attended by thousands of people, who carried his coffin on their shoulders and chanted slogans in his honor. He was buried in a shrine near Lahore, which became a place of pilgrimage for many Muslims.
 
The aftermath [ edit] The assassination of Rajpal had far-reaching consequences for India's religious and political landscape. It intensified the communal tension between Hindus and Muslims, which eventually led to the partition of India in 1947. It also prompted the British government to amend Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code in 1929, which made it a criminal offense to insult or attempt to insult the religion or religious beliefs of any class of citizens with deliberate and malicious intention. This law is still in force in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh today, and has been used to prosecute many cases of alleged blasphemy against Islam or other religions.
 
Rangila Rasul remains a controversial book that is banned in many countries and is considered offensive by many Muslims. However, some people view it as a historical document that exposes the hypocrisy and corruption of organized religion. It also raises important questions about freedom of expression, religious tolerance and communal harmony in modern society.
